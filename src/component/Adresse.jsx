        <p>According to Le Petit Robert of Proper Names 3 , "  Hitler  " is a variant of "  Hüttler  ", 
            from the German Hüttle meaning "little hut  " (may have referred to a man living near a hut; in Bavaria , referred to a carpenter) .

Hitler is named after his father Alois ' stepfather , Johann Georg Hiedler (in a different spelling, but the pronunciation is very close).
The latter married Hitler's grandmother,
 Maria Anna Schicklgruber , after the birth of Alois, without it being known whether he was the father.
 Alois was registered under his mother's name, with the mention illegitimate son ,
 and later adopted his stepfather's name, in the form Hitler 4 , 5 .

Hitler was christened Adolphus Hitler . In the 19th  century, Adolf was a common first name in German-speaking and Scandinavian countries.

According to the identification sheet established by French intelligence in 1924, Hitler's middle name was Jakob (Jacques, in German),
but this sheet contains various gross errors, including Hitler's date and place of birth,
and nothing corroborates the thesis of a middle name</p>
